## Frontend task
This is a small task you will have to create to prove you are capable of what you say. 

### Description
Take data from [our locations api](https://api.photodino.com/locations) and create a react app for interacting with it.
The app will be broken down to 3 parts:
#### Cities
This is where all city data is displayed. This allows looking at all cities at a glance, filter and sort through them.
#### Locations (hotels)
Each city has locations, usually hotels, where photoshoots happen. The section, like `Cities`, should be able to provide a view of all locations, and allow for sorting, and filtering.
#### Detailed view of a location or city
For both city and locations should have a detailed view of a selected city or location. This is where we get all details related to that city or location.
### App Tasks
The following is what the app should be able to do to be considered complete.
 - Present all the cities and hotels in a beautiful, clean and organized manner
 - Allow sorting by `name`, `street`, and `time_created`
 - Create new cities and locations
 - Modify existing locations or cities
 - Delete a specified location or city

You write make the backend in whatever language you wish, but it is encouraged that you use python.

### What we are looking for
When we look at your app, we will look at various things to determine if you fit. The following is a short but incomplete list:
 - *Code quality.* How you code is as import as what you code. A candidate who can write high quality code is at the cornerstone of what we are looking for.
 - *Code efficiency.* You may write good looking and readable code, but how efficently does it solve the problem? We will analyze your code and look for anti-patterns and code smell, and portential technical debt issues.
 - *Visual appeal.* This is a frontend app and therefor, must look appealing to the eye. This is completely subjective, so do the best you can.
 - *App usage.* We will look at how easy or difficult it is to navigate and use the app. The app should also be accessible to those with imparements.

 ### How to present your work
 When you have finished making the app, host it on any platform of you choosing, and provide the link to us. Place the code in a github repo with instructions on how to run it locallly. Any neccessary documentation can also be included.
